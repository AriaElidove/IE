Factory Windows
The grime is obligatory
<&window_recipes>Framed glass windows allow some natural light to make its way into the factory, as to not rely on <link;engineered_lighting;lanterns> alone.<br>
Frames made from Treated Wood are thicker, while Steel and Aluminium make for a thinner one.<br>
Unlike normal glass panes, these windows can be placed horizontally in addition to vertically, to act as skylights!

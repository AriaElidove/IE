Accumulator Backpack
Do....Ray....Egon!
Energy storage takes space and some heavyweight components. As such, storing large amounts of energy in each tool individually is inefficient and makes them awkward to wield.
The Accumulator Backpack acts as a compromise, offering a centralized storage of energy for any powered tools to tap into. You construct its carrying frame with the recipe shown here. After that you can take it to the <link;workbench;Engineer's Workbench;start> in order to place an <link;accumulators;Accumulator> inside it.
The backpack charges any tools in your hands, as well as any armor you are wearing. You can wear it like a piece of chest armor, or you may craft it with a chestpiece to attach it and gain the benefit of a power-supply as well as protection.<np>
<&antenna>By attaching a §2Charging Antenna§r to the backpack, you can charge its accumulator on the go! Simply walk underneath an <link;wiring;un-insulated powerline;wire_recipes> to have the antenna connect to it.<br>
While you remain close enough to the wire, the antenna will flex and stay connected, slowly charging the accumulator from the wire network.
